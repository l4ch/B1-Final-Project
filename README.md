# B1-Final-Project
This purpose of this report was to determine if Copilot (VSCodeâ€™s inbuilt AI tool) was able to independently produce fast and accurate FFTs of audio samples typically used in music production. This was done by comparing Al and human-written functions with and without the use of libraries. Validation was performed by comparing graphs, comparing the peak frequency of each graph, computing the sum of absolute differences between all points in the FFT and recording the time taken for each set of FFT algorithms. It was determined that Copilot was able to produce satisfactory results, provided it was given access to libraries such as scipy. If Copilot was not given access to these libraries, it was unable to produce functional code. It was also determined that the chosen methods and metrics were sufficient for determining these results.

In order to use this code, run b1final.py in a virtual environment containing the numpy, scipy, matplotlib and time libraries.
